3. Next Steps: if I had more time

    - play with collapsible/hidden nav bar
    - change the way contact page displays information
        - possibly use javascript to show/hide on click
    - totally change layout on media queries (keep theme but change some elements)
    - be able to click project images and make them get bigger (in pop out module?)
