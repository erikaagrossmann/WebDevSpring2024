				My name is Erika Grossman and I am a digital artist at NYU's Tandon School Of Engineering. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Integrated Design and Media with a cross-school minor in Business of Entertainment, Media, and Technology at NYU's Steinhart, Stern, and Tisch schools.
            I am originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania but have wanted to move to live in New York City since I was 8. I am so excited to finally be living in this beautiful city full of endless dreams and can't wait to see what my future holds here!
