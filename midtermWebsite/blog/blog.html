					<h4>Spotted: Upper East Side Intrigue Unveiled!</h4>
					<img src="#" alt="gg" />
					<p>
						Hey Upper East Siders,
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It's your one and only source into the
						scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite, and boy, do we have some
						juicy updates for you. Grab your designer bags and fasten your
						seatbelts because things are heating up on the Upper East Side.
						<br/>
                        <br/>
                        First off, let's talk about the latest love triangle causing a stir.
						Rumor has it that Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen are once
						again entangled in a web of romance and rivalry. With their
						complicated history and undeniable chemistry, it's anyone's guess
						where this rollercoaster of emotions will take them next. Will love
						conquer all, or will their friendship be torn apart by secrets and
						betrayal? 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Meanwhile, over at the Empire Hotel, it seems like Chuck
						Bass is up to his old tricks. Sources say he's been spotted wining
						and dining a mystery brunette who's not exactly on Blair's guest
						list. Could this be the beginning of a new romance, or is Chuck
						playing a dangerous game that will ultimately lead to heartbreak?
						<br/>
                        <br/>
                        And let's not forget about our favorite Brooklyn boy, Dan Humphrey.
						Word on the street is that he's been spending a lot of time at the
						Humphrey Residence, fueling speculation about his next big literary
						masterpiece. Could Dan be cooking up a scandalous expos√© that will
						rock the Upper East Side to its core?
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        As always, Upper East Siders,
						you know you love me. xoxo, Gossip Girl
