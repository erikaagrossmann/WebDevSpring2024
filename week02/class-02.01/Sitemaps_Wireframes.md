# Today's Notes- 02/01

## site maps and wireframes

- content organization
    - within page, and site wide

sitemap is often the first visual presented to client
- how user will nagigate
- help developer plan how to build site
- help designer plan out what content will go on each page 

ex. recipe website

first navigation is by course (breakfast, lunch, dinner)

second navigation is main ingredient (vegetarian, poultry, fish, beef, pork, ect.)

its a website!- also need a homepage, about the author, contact page, etc.


## UX- User Experience
is... human interaction with a product

- involves a persons emotions ad attitudes about a particular product, system, or service
- ux can be- researchers, designers, and developers
- test how someone who has never seen the thing before interacts with it

for wireframes
- focus is on organizing content, not colors or images
- given to developers so they know how to build the structure for each page
- given to designers so they can see what should go where on the page

html tags are helpful!
- div: box around content
- span: box around content, grabbing specific sentence in paragraph
- article
- summary
- section
- header
- aside
- details
- figcaption
- figure
- footer
- main
- mark
- nav
- time
